📊 Price Elasticity Analysis using Machine Learning

🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes how changes in product prices affect customer demand across different product categories using machine learning and statistical modeling.

Price Elasticity of Demand helps businesses understand customer sensitivity to price changes.



🎯 Objectives
- Analyze price–demand relationship
- Calculate price elasticity
- Compare elasticity across categories
- Identify elastic and inelastic products
- Support pricing strategy decisions



📂 Dataset
The dataset contains:

| Column | Description |
|------|-------------|
| date | Sales date |
| product_id | Product identifier |
| category | Product category |
| price | Product price |
| demand | Units sold |



🧠 Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Log–log regression model
- Linear Regression
- Data visualization
- Business interpretation



📈 Price Elasticity Formula

Elasticity = (% Change in Demand) / (% Change in Price)

Log model used:

log(Demand) = β × log(Price) + c

Where:
- β = Price Elasticity



📊 Results Interpretation

| Elasticity Value | Meaning |
|------------------|---------|
| < -1 | Elastic demand |
| -1 to 0 | Inelastic demand |
| > 0 | Abnormal demand |



🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn



📌 Use Cases
- Retail pricing strategy
- Discount optimization
- Revenue forecasting
- Category-level demand analysis
