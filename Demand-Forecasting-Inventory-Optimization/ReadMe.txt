PROJECT TITLE:
Demand Forecasting with Inventory Optimization

DESCRIPTION:
This project uses Machine Learning to predict future product demand
and applies inventory optimization techniques to determine:

- Safety Stock
- Reorder Point
- Optimal Inventory Levels

OBJECTIVES:
- Predict future sales demand
- Reduce stockouts
- Minimize excess inventory
- Improve supply chain efficiency

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

ML MODEL:
- Random Forest Regressor

FEATURES:
- Demand prediction
- Time-based feature engineering
- Inventory optimization formulas
- Visual demand analysis

INVENTORY FORMULAS:
Safety Stock = Z × σ × √LeadTime

Reorder Point = (Average Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock

DATASET:
- Historical sales data
- Pricing and promotion indicators

OUTPUT:
- Forecasted demand
- Optimal reorder point
- Safety stock calculation
- Demand visualization graph
